The pace of technological innovation, as well as the range of applications in which IoT devices are being deployed, makes it difficult to predict future challenges or to prioritise them. For this reason, we have reserved a portion of the initial funding to be allocated in a call for projects open to researchers within the Hub towards the end of this year (December 2016) – we call it the Strategic Research Fund Call. The SRFC will allow PETRAS to take advantage of the multi- disciplinary expertise within the Hub and the research capacity of its university partners to better address the challenges of the Resilience of Systems, including, the malicious threats taking account of both their physical and their human elements. To maximize the potential impact and coverage of the SRFC, we are requesting funding from the Lloyds Register Foundation to commission research that will align the relevant outputs of PETRAS with LFR’s Resilience Agenda to build resilience within and between critical infrastructure sectors by increasing our understanding of the threats and opportunities of the Internet of Things. The SRFC will allow LRF to leverage the already significant funds PETRAS has by sponsoring 2-3 additional projects focusing specifically on Resilience Engineering issues – to be defined in detail with LRF - and it will allow PETRAS to extend the collaboration to non-PETRAS partners.","London, United Kingdom",51.5073509,-0.1277583,POINT (-0.1277583 51.5073509),"['petras', 'uk', 'research', 'hub', 'cybersecurity', 'internet', 'things', 'hub', 'investigate', 'privacy', 'ethics', 'trust', 'reliability', 'acceptability', 'security', 'iot', 'environments', 'establish', 'government', 'february', 'hub', 'initiate', 'broad', 'spectrum', 'project', 'however', 'diversity', 'iot', 'products', 'service', 'range', 'thematic', 'areas', 'hub', 'try', 'address', 'mean', 'investigate', 'discrete', 'point', 'across', 'research', 'space', 'pace', 'technological', 'innovation', 'well', 'range', 'applications', 'iot', 'devices', 'deploy', 'make', 'difficult', 'predict', 'future', 'challenge', 'prioritise', 'reason', 'reserve', 'portion', 'initial', 'allocate', 'call', 'project', 'open', 'researchers', 'within', 'hub', 'towards', 'end', 'year', 'december', '2016', 'call', 'strategic', 'research', 'call', 'srfc', 'allow', 'petras', 'take', 'advantage', 'multi', 'disciplinary', 'expertise', 'within', 'hub', 'research', 'capacity', 'university', 'partner', 'better', 'address', 'challenge', 'resilience', 'systems', 'include', 'malicious', 'threats', 'take', 'account', 'physical', 'human', 'elements', 'maximize', 'potential', 'impact', 'coverage', 'srfc', 'request', 'lloyds', 'register', 'foundation', 'commission', 'research', 'align', 'relevant', 'output', 'petras', 'lfr', 'resilience', 'agenda', 'build', 'resilience', 'within', 'critical', 'infrastructure', 'sectors', 'increase', 'understand', 'threats', 'opportunities', 'internet', 'things', 'srfc', 'allow', 'lrf', 'leverage', 'already', 'significant', 'fund', 'petras', 'sponsor', '23', 'additional', 'project', 'focus', 'specifically', 'resilience', 'engineer', 'issue', 'define', 'detail', 'lrf', 'allow', 'petras', 'extend', 'collaboration', 'nonpetras', 'partner']"

We are asking the Foundation to support this current series, including the flagship debate during British Science Week.   The funding will enable us to provide tailored support for the regional events - through generating local publicity and supporting our volunteer teams on the ground. We will also be able to live-stream the flagship event in London via our YouTube channel and source questions via social media, opening up the event to a larger audience. We would also host networking receptions after each event.","London, United Kingdom",51.5073509,-0.1277583,POINT (-0.1277583 51.5073509),"['application', 'towards', 'british', 'science', 'association', 'bsa', 'future', 'debate', 'series', 'one', 'lloyd', 'register', 'foundation', 'key', 'strategic', 'theme', 'advance', 'public', 'understand', 'risk', 'bsa', 'want', 'empower', 'people', 'engage', 'debate', 'science', 'role', 'live', 'economy', 'future', 'future', 'debate', 'series', 'platform', 'conversations', 'enable', 'people', 'make', 'rational', 'inform', 'decisions', 'important', 'areas', 'research', 'implications', 'society', 'series', 'tackle', 'topic', 'robotics', 'autonomous', 'systems', 'ras', 'january', 'march', '2016', 'hold', 'local', 'events', 'plymouth', 'preston', 'flagship', 'debate', 'london', '16', 'march', 'panel', 'feature', 'range', 'spokespeople', 'scientists', 'engineer', 'work', 'cut', 'edge', 'research', 'also', 'designers', 'lawyers', 'philosophers', 'science', 'look', 'isolation', 'intersect', 'section', 'society', 'public', 'concern', 'around', 'social', 'issue', 'technology', 'affect', 'live', 'question', 'work', 'one', 'priority', 'foundation', 'communication', 'public', 'debate', 'scientific', 'research', 'future', 'debate', 'share', 'objective', 'moreover', 'current', 'topic', 'ras', 'align', 'theme', 'next', 'foresight', 'review', 'ask', 'foundation', 'current', 'series', 'include', 'flagship', 'debate', 'british', 'science', 'week', 'enable', 'us', 'tailor', 'regional', 'events', 'generate', 'local', 'publicity', 'support', 'volunteer', 'team', 'grind', 'also', 'able', 'livestream', 'flagship', 'event', 'london', 'via', 'youtube', 'channel', 'source', 'question', 'via', 'social', 'media', 'open', 'event', 'larger', 'audience', 'would', 'also', 'host', 'network', 'receptions', 'event']"

The aim of the program is to provide fellows with opportunity to improve their advocacy skills and enhance their ability to deal with the media in their own regions. The program would be delivered by Release in partnership with other leading drug policy NGOs and academics based in the UK. The program will address the following areas: introduction to the international drug policy reform movement and the main stakeholders; drug policy developments in Latin America and around the world; and presentation skills, including engaging with the media and tools for debate. Opportunities to meet with key drug policy organisations, experts and leading policy advocates will be provided. On completion of the two week training programme fellows would continue to receive support from Release through a mentoring scheme. A specific member of staff would be responsible for mentoring each fellow for six months after completion of the training program. Objectives The main aim of the project is to add to the core group of existing activists in the region and to increase capacity in terms of high profile advocates. The objectives of the project are that the participants: • increase their knowledge of global drug policy reform issues on a region by region approach; • increase their understanding of the international drug control system and system incoherence with other parts of the UN; • have a greater awareness of the drug policy reform movement and in particular the key players within that movement; • establish closer connections with those working in drug policy, particularly in the UK; • build and develop their communications skills in terms of media interviews, press releases, press databases and public speaking; • have understanding of the tools of debate, so that they confidently challenge positions espoused by those advocating against reform. • improve their confidence through participation in the program and through ongoing support from Release. Outcomes The fellowship program will achieve the following results: • Increased knowledge of media and public speaking outreach. This will enable fellows to more effectively engage in the drug policy debate in their region. The overall aim of this outcome will be to ensure that there is increase in capacity of high quality speakers in Latin and Central America so as to further enhance the debate. • Increased interaction and relationship building between those working in Latin America and the International NGOs based in London.
